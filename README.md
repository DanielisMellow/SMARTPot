# SDFinalProject


Use C/C++ and the ESP32 microcontroller in conjunction to create a self watering flowerpot and GUI. The microcontroller will take readings from a capacitance soil moisture sensor (CSMS) to determine if the soil is dry and requires watering. In addition a GPIO pin will be in charge of triggering a small water pump to water the flowerpot. A complementary GUI will be created that will allow a user to to trigger the watering sequence and display moisture readings from (CSMS)
The GUI and source code for the microcontroller will be written in C++.
